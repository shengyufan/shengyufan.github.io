Currently I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at [the University of New South Wales (UNSW)](https://www.unsw.edu.au/), supervised by Dr. [Xin Cao](https://xincao-unsw.github.io/) and Prof. [Wenjie Zhang](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~zhangw/). Prior to that, I obtained the M.Sc. degree in Information Technology from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/) and the B.Eng. degree in Software Engineering from [Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU)](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/).
