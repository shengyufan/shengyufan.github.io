Currently I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at [the University of New South Wales (UNSW)](https://www.unsw.edu.au/), supervised by Dr. [Xin Cao](https://xincao-unsw.github.io/) and Prof. [Wenjie Zhang](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~zhangw/). Additionally, I am fortunate to work under the guidance of esteemed supervisors, Dr. [Kaiqi Zhao](https://kaiqi.blogs.auckland.ac.nz/) and Dr. [Yixiang Fang](https://fangyixiang.github.io/) from diverse institutions. Their expertise and support have been invaluable to my research.

Prior to that, I obtained the M.Sc. degree in Information Technology from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/) and the B.Eng. degree in Software Engineering from [Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU)](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/).

My research interests focus on machine learning for database system, especially for spatial database. Feel free to contact me at [yufan.sheng\[AT\]unsw.edu.au](mailto:yufan.sheng@unsw.edu.au).
